[[migration-from-modjk]]
== Migration from mod_jk

Mod_cluster only support Apache httpd, there are no plan to support IIS
or IPlanet.

The migration from mod_jk to mod_cluster is not very complex. Only
very few worker properties can't be mapped to mod_cluster parameters.

Here is the table of worker properties and how to transfer them in the
ClusterListener parameters.

[options="header"]
|===
|mod_jk worker property |ClusterListener parameter |Remarks
|host | - | It is read from the &lt;Connector/&gt; Address information
|port | - | It is read from the &lt;Connector/&gt; Port information
|type | - | It is read from the &lt;Connector/&gt; Protocol information
|route | - | It is read from the &lt;Engine/&gt; JVMRoute information
|domain | domain | That is not supported in this version
|redirect | - | The nodes with loadfactor = 0 are standby nodes they will be used no other nodes are available
|socket_timeout | nodeTimeout | Default 10 seconds
|socket_keepalive | - | KEEP_ALIVE os is always on in mod_cluster
|connection_pool_size | - | The max size is calculated to be AP_MPMQ_MAX_THREADS+1 (max)
|connection_pool_minsize | smax | The defaut is max
|connection_pool_timeout | ttl | Time to live when over smax connections. The defaut is 60 seconds
|- | workerTimeout | Max time to wait for a free worker default 1 second
|retries | maxAttempts | Max retries before returning an error Default: 3
|recovery_options | - | mod_cluster behave like mod_jk with value 7
|fail_on_status | - | Not supported
|max_packet_size | iobuffersize/receivebuffersize| Not supported in this version. Use ProxyIOBufferSize
|max_reply_timeouts | - | Not supported
|recovert_time | - | The ClusterListener will tell (via a STATUS message) mod_cluster that the node is up again
|activation | - | mod_cluster receives this information via ENABLE/DISABLE/STOP messages
|distance | - | mod_cluster handles this via the loadfactor logic
|mount | - | The context "mounted" automaticly via the ENABLE-APP messages. ProxyPass could be used too
|secret | - | Not supported
|connect_timeout | - | Not supported. Use ProxyTimeout or server TimeOut (Default 300 seconds)
|prepost_timeout | ping | Default 10 seconds
|reply_timeout | - | Not supported. Use ProxyTimeout or server TimeOut? directive (Default 300 seconds)

[[migration-from-modproxy]]
== Migration from mod_proxy

As mod_cluster is a sophisticated balancer migration from mod_proxy to
mod_cluster is strait forward. mod_cluster replaces a reverse proxy
with loadbalancing. A reversed proxy is configured like:

[source]
----
ProxyRequests Off
<Proxy *>
Order deny,allow
Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /foo http://foo.example.com/bar
ProxyPassReverse /foo http://foo.example.com/bar
----

All the general proxy parameters could be used in mod_cluster they work
like in mod_proxy, only the balancers and the workers definitions are
slightly different.

=== Workers

[options="header"]
|===
|Mod_proxy Parameter |ClusterListener parameter | Remarks
| min | - | Not supported in this version
| max | - | mod_cluster uses mod_proxy default value
| smax | smax | Same as mod_proxy
| ttl | ttl | Same as mod_proxy
| acquire | workerTimeout | Same as mod_proxy acquire but in seconds
| disablereuse | - | mod_cluster will disable the node in case of error and the ClusterListener will for the reuse via the STATUS message
| flushPackets | flushPackets | Same as mod_proxy
| flushwait | flushwait | Same as mod_proxy
| keepalive | - | Always on: OS KEEP_ALIVE is always used. Use connectionTimeout in the &lt;Connector&gt; if needed
| lbset | - | Not supported
| ping | ping | Same as mod_proxy Default value 10 seconds
| lbfactor | - | The load factor is received by mod_cluster from a calculated value in the ClusterListener
| redirect | - | Not supported lbfactor sent to 0 makes a standby node
| retry | - | ClusterListener will test when the node is back online
| route | JVMRoute | In fact JBossWEB via the JVMRoute in the Engine will add it
| status | - | mod_cluster has a finer status handling: by context via the ENABLE/STOP/DISABLE/REMOVE application messages. hot-standby is done by lbfactor = 0 and Error by lbfactor = 1 both values are sent in STATUS message by the ClusterListener
| timeout | nodeTimeout | Default wait for ever (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html] is wrong there)
| ttl | ttl | Default 60 seconds
|===

=== Balancers

[options="header"]
|===
| Mod_proxy Parameter | ClusterListener parameter | Remarks
| lbmethod | - | There is only one load balancing method in mod_cluster "cluster_byrequests"
| maxattempts | maxAttempts | Default 1
| nofailover | stickySessionForce | Same as in mod_proxy
| stickysession | StickySessionCookie/StickySessionPath | The 2 parameters in the ClusterListener are combined in one that behaves like in mod_proxy
| timeout | workerTimeout | Default 1 seconds
