= Load Balancing Demo Application

NOTE: {editurl}demo.adoc[{editnote}]

== Overview

The mod_cluster distribution includes a demo application that helps
demonstrate how different server-side scenarios affect the routing of
client requests by the load balancer. The demo application is located in
the mod_cluster distribution's demo directory.

The demo application consists of two components:

. The first component is a war file that needs to be deployed in
JBossWeb/Tomcat/JBoss AS. The war includes a number of servlets.

. The second component is a GUI application that allows a user to
launch a pool of threads that repeatedly make requests to the load
balancer. The requests are ultimately routed to the demo war's
primary servlet. The application tracks which servers are handling
the requests and displays this information in a chart.

The application can also send separate requests to the demo war's
load generation servlets, allowing the user to see how different
load conditions affect the balancing of requests.

Note that the demo application does not actually depend on mod_cluster
in any way. Its only dependency is on JBossWeb/Tomcat.
^[link:#ftn.d0e3653[1]]^ Consequently, the demo can be used to demonstrate
the effect of different server-side scenarios on the routing decisions
made by any load balancer, including mod_jk, mod_proxy or the various
hardware load balancers.

Note also that this demo application is not intended to be used as a
load testing tool; i.e. something that can demonstrate the maximum load
a cluster configuration can handle. Using it as such has a good chance
of showing you the maximum load the client can generate rather than the
maximum load your cluster can handle.

== Basic Usage

To run the demo application:

. Unpack the mod_cluster distribution on your filesystem. Here we
assume it has been unzipped to ~/mod_cluster or C:\mod_cluster.

. Install mod_cluster into your httpd server as described at Installation of the httpd part

. Install mod_cluster into your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers as
described at link:#java.install[Installation on the Java
side]

. In AS7 you have to set org.apache.tomcat.util.ENABLE_MODELER to
true, Something like:

[source,xml]
----
<system-properties>
    <property name="org.apache.tomcat.util.ENABLE_MODELER" value="true"/>
</system-properties>
----

. Start httpd and your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers

. Deploy the load-demo.war found in the distribution's demo/server
folder to your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers.

. Start the demo application:

.. On *nix:

[source]
----
cd ~/mod_cluster/demo/client
./run-demo.sh
----

.. On Windows

[source]
----
C:\> cd mod_cluster\demo\client
C:\mod_cluster\demo\client> run-demo
----

. Configure the hostname and address of the httpd server, the number
of client threads, etc and click the "Start" button. See link:#client-config[Client
Driver Configuration
Options]
for details on the configuration options.

. Switch to the "Request Balancing" tab to see how many requests are
going to each of your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers.

. Switch to the "Session Balancing" tab to see how many active
sessions link:#[^link:#[^]link:#ftn.d0e3726[2][^]^] are being hosted by each
of your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers.

. Stop some of your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers and/or undeploy
the load-demo.war from some of the servers and see the effect this
has on load balancing.

. Restart some of your JBossAS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers and/or
re-deploy the load-demo.war to some of the servers and see the
effect this has on load balancing.

. Experiment with adding artificial load to one or more servers to see
what effect that has on load balancing. See link:#load-generation[Load Generation
Scenarios] for
details.

Most of the various panels in application interface also present
information on the current status on any client threads. "Total Clients"
is the number of client threads created since the last time the "Start"
button was pushed. "Live Clients" is the number of threads currently
running. "Failed Clients" is the number of clients that terminated
abnormally; i.e. made a request that resulted in something other than an
HTTP 200 response.

== Client Driver Configuration Options

The configuration of the client is driver is done via the application's
"Clent Control" tab.

image::demo-client-control.jpg[]

The panel includes the following options:

* Proxy Hostname: Hostname of the load balancer or the IP address on
which it is listening for requests ^[link:#ftn.d0e3759[3]]^

* Proxy Port: Port on which the load balancer is listening for
requests ^[link:#ftn.d0e3772[4]]^

* Context Path: Portion of the request URL that specifies the request
is for the load-demo.war

* Session Life: Number of seconds a client thread should use a session
before invalidating or abandoning it. Generally it is good to keep
this to a small value; otherwise the use of session stickiness will
prevent changes in server load from affecting the load balancer's
routing decisions. With sticky sessions enabled (strongly
recommended), it is the creation of a new session that allows the
load balancer to try to balance load.

* Invalidate: Controls what the client thread should do when it stops
using a session because Session Life has passed. If checked, the
driver will send a request that results in the session being
invalidated. If unchecked, the session will just be abandoned, and
will continue to exist on the server until Session Timeout seconds
have passed. In the future this will likely be changed to a
percentage input, so X% can be invalidated, the rest abandoned.

* Session Timeout: Number of seconds a session can remain unused
before the server is free to expire it. Unchecking Invalidate and
setting a high value relative to Session Life allows a significant
number of unused sessions to accumulate on the server.

* Num Threads: Number of client threads to launch. Each thread
repeatedly makes requests until the "Stop" button is pushed or a
request receives a response other than HTTP 200.

* Sleep Time: Number of ms the client threads should sleep between
requests.

* Startup Time: Number of seconds over which the application should
stagger the start of the client threads. Staggering the start
advised as it avoids the unnatural situation where for the life of
the demonstation all sessions start at about the same time and then
are invalidated or abandoned at the same time. Staggering the start
allows the load balancer to continually see new sessions and decide
how to route them.

== Load Generation Scenarios

You can use the application's GUI to instruct individual servers to
artificially generate various types of load, and then track how that
load affects request and session balancing. Load generation is
controlled via the application's "Server Load Control" tab.

The panel includes the following options:

* Target Hostname and Target Port: The hostname or IP address of the
server on which you want load generated. There are two strategies
for setting these:

* You can use the hostname and port of the load balancer, in which
case the load balancer will pick a backend server and route the
request to it. Note the client application does not maintain a
session cookie for these requests, so if you invoke another
server load generation request, you shouldn't expect the same
server to handle it.

* If the JBoss AS/JBossWeb/Tomcat servers are running the
HttpConnector as well as the AJP connector, you can specify the
address and port on which a particular server's HttpConnector is
listening. The standard port is 8080.

* Load Creation Action: Specifies the type of load the target server
should generate. See below for details on the available load types.

* Params: Zero or more parameters to pass to the specified load
creation servlet. For example, in the screenshot above, Number of
Connections and Duration. How many parameters are displayed, their
name and their meaning depend on the selected Load Creation Action.
The label for each parameter includes a tooltip that explains its
use.

The available Load Creation Actions are as follows:

[glossary]
Active Sessions::
    Generates server load by causing session creation on the target
server.
[glossary]
Datasource Use::
    Generates server load by taking connections from the
java:DefaultDS datasource for a period
[glossary]
Connection Pool Use::
    Generates server load by tieing up threads in the webserver
connections pool for a period
[glossary]
Heap Memory Pool Use::
    Generates server load by filling 50% of free heap memory for a
period
[glossary]
CPU Use::
    Generates server CPU load by initiating a tight loop in a thread
[glossary]
Server Receive Traffic::
    Generates server traffic receipt load by POSTing a large byte
array to the server once per second for a period
[glossary]
Server Send Traffic::
    Generates server traffic send load by making a request once per
second to which the server responds with a large byte array
[glossary]
Request Count::
    Generates server load by making numerous requests, increasing
the request count on the target server

^[link:#d0e3653[1]]^The demo's "Datasource Use" load generation scenario
requires the use of JBoss Application Server.

^[link:#d0e3726[2]]^ For purposes of this chart, a session is considered
"active" if a client thread will ever again send a request associated
with the session. When client threads stop using a session, they can
either send a request to invalidate it or just abandon it by no longer
including its session cookie in requests. After a session is abandoned,
it will not be reflected in the "Session Balancing" chart, but it will
continue to exist on the JBossWeb/Tomcat/JBoss AS server until it is
removed due to timeout.

^[link:#d0e3759[3]]^ The default value for this field is controlled by the
`mod_cluster.proxy.host` system property, or localhost if not
set. Editing the run-demo.sh or run-demo.bat file to change the
`-Dmod_cluster.proxy.host=localhost` passed to java will allow
you to avoid re-typing this value every time you launch the demo
application.

^[link:#d0e3772[4]]^ The default value for this field is controlled by the
`mod_cluster.proxy.port` system property, or 8000 if not set.
Editing the run-demo.sh or run-demo.bat file to change the
`-Dmod_cluster.proxy.port=8000` passed to java will allow you to
avoid re-typing this value every time you launch the demo application.
