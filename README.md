mod_cluster
===========

Project mod_cluster is a httpd-based load-balancer. It uses a communication channel to forward
requests from httpd to one of a set of application server nodes. Unlike mod_jk and mod_proxy,
mod_cluster leverages an additional connection between the application server nodes and httpd
to transmit server-side load-balance factors and lifecycle events back to httpd. This additional
feedback channel allows mod_cluster to offer a level of intelligence and granularity not found in
other load-balancing solutions.

Mod_cluster boasts the following advantages over other httpd-based load-balancers:

* Dynamic configuration of httpd workers
* Server-side load balance factor calculation
* Fine grained web-app lifecycle control
* AJP is optional

Installation
------------

### JBoss AS 7/WildFly 8+

These versions already ship with bundled mod_cluster. It is configured via mod_cluster
subsystem.


### JBoss AS 6

This is the first version of AS that bundled mod_cluster, the configuration is located in
`/server/<profile>/deploy/mod_cluster.sar/META-INF` directory.


### JBoss Web / Tomcat

The `tar.gz` from the assembly contains the `JBossWeb-Tomcat`.

1. Extract the `JBossWeb-Tomcat` directory.
2. Copy the JAR files from `JBossWeb-Tomcat/lib` to the Tomcat lib.
3. Remove the `mod_cluster-container-tomcat(n).jar` that don't correspond to
   the Tomcat version you are using.
3. Copy the `JBossWeb-Tomcat/lib/jboss-logging-jdk.jar` and `JBossWeb-Tomcat/lib/jboss-logging-spi.jar`
   dependency jars into the same `lib` directory.
4. Modify `server.xml` within the `conf` directory and add a non-cluster mode
   engine listener as documented [here](http://docs.jboss.org/mod_cluster/1.2.0/html/Quick_Start_Guide.html).

Building
--------

### Servlet Container Modules

Before building, ensure you have Maven version 3.0 or newer (`mvn -version`) and JDK 6.0 or newer (`java -version`). 
It is possible to build modules for all containers:

    mvn install

Distribution package:

    mvn -P dist package

Dynamic load-balancing demo is located in the `/demo` directory:

    mvn install
